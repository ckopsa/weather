* weather
A python script to pull the weather from weather.com given a US zip-code.

Created to be used in my polybar setup because I didn't like needing an api key
to get the weather.
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./weather [zip-code]
  # OR
  python3 weather [zip-code]
#+END_SRC
** Dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install bs4
#+END_SRC
