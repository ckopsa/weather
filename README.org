* weather
A python script to pull the weather from weather.com given a US zip-code.

Created to be used in my polybar setup because I didn't like needing an api key
to get the weather.
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./weather.py [zip-code]
  # OR
  python3 weather.py [zip-code]
#+END_SRC
** Dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install bs4
#+END_SRC
** Setup
   /weather.py/ uses the file /weather.txt/ to write the most recent weather to,
   in the event a request times out. Creating this file is crucial to the
   successful use of /weather.py/.
** TODO polybar
